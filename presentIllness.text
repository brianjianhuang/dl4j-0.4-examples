male with a past medical history of squamous cell lung cancertreated with right total pneumonectomy, chronic obstructivepulmonary disease on 2 to 3 liters of home oxygen withsaturations in the low 90s at baseline, congestive heartfailure, and diabetes mellitus type 2 who was recentlyadmitted from [**7-11**] to [**2535-7-15**] for presumedbronchitis or bronchiectasis flare here with recurrent cough,shortness of breath and fevers.  During his last admissiontwo weeks ago he was treated for chronic obstructivepulmonary disease flare versus bronchitis with a ten dayPrednisone taper and Augmentin for one week.  He underwentbronchoscopy due to concern for possible endobronchiallesion, which was normal.  Sputum sample was done at thattime showed no growth.  He was discharged at his baselinefunction on [**2535-7-15**].  The plan was to treat him for oneweek of Augmentin, skip one week followed by Bactrim for oneweek, skip one week and then on Augmentin for two weeks forpneumonia prophylaxis.  The last dose of Augmentin was[**2535-7-18**] after being on Augmentin for only three days.He was doing well until approximately one week ago when hedeveloped mild spasms in the afternoon that he thought wasdue to low potassium.

Thepatient did note that since [**Month (only) 213**], a Scopolamine patch wasadded to his regimen and has increased his secretionssignificantly.EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Per Emergency Room, the patientappeared close to intubation upon presentation and was placedon 100% oxygen via non-rebreather with an ABG of 7.46, pCO2of 48, and pO2 of 33.  There was a question if this was avenous gas or not.  Lasix 100 mg IV, Albuterol nebs,Solu-Medrol 600 mg IV, and Ceftriaxone 1 g IV was given tothe patient.  When evaluated by the MICU shortly afterarrival to the Emergency Room, the patient was weaned down tobaseline of 2 L oxygen with oxygen saturation of 100% vianasal cannula.  The patient was breathing comfortably at18-20 breaths/min.  The patient no longer complained ofshortness of breath but did state that he felt slightlytired.

While in theEmergency Department, he was transfused 4 units of packed redblood cells, 2 units of fresh frozen plasma, and got 2 mg ofsubcutaneous Vitamin K.  The patient was admitted to theMedicine Floor.  Repeat hematocrit several hours laterdropped to a value of 13.  The nasogastric tube was placed onthe floor with nasogastric lavage negative for fresh blood.He was, at that point, transferred to the Medical IntensiveCare Unit.  Workup while in the Medical Intensive Care Unitincluded two esophagogastroduodenoscopies, both without freshblood or old blood but demonstrating a single raised 5 to 7cm esophageal nodule on an erythematous base at approximately25 cm.
