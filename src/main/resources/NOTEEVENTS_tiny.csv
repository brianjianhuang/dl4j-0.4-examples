Radiology:
CXR [**9-28**]: Diffusely increased opacities at the lung fields
bilaterally. In an immunocompromised patient, this is concerning
for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2**]. Radiographically, the differential includes
pulmonary edema. Additionally, there is a faint opacity at the
right lung base, which may represent atelectasis or focal
pneumonic process.
.
CT-Head [**9-28**]: Focus of low attenuation within the subcortical
white matter of the right medial frontal lobe. This may
represent a subacute infarction; however, an underlying mass
lesion cannot be completely excluded. An MRI examination with
gadolinium and diffusion-weighted imaging is recommended for
further evaluation. No intracranial hemorrhage noted.
.
MR-head-w&w/o gadolinium [**9-30**]:
Signal abnormality in the medial right frontal lobe involving
the corpus callosum does not demonstrate enhancement. This
finding most likely represent a small infarct. However, in
absence of ADC map, age of the infarct could not be determined.
No abnormal enhancement is seen. Follow up is suggested, if
clinically indicated.
.
Echo [**9-30**]:
1.The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. While difficult to
assess given the limited views suspect Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
.
If clinically indicated, would recommend a TEE.
.
CXR [**10-3**]:
Resolution of congestive failure with persistent small bilateral
pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis
.
Studies:
EEG [**9-29**]: This is a mildly abnormal EEG due to the presence of
a slow
and disorganized background with bursts of generalized slowing -
all
consistent with a mild encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or
anoxic
etiology. No evidence for ongoing seizures is seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  54 woman on immunosuppressive therapy for UC (prednisone,
6MP) who presents with new onset HA, fever with bacterial
meningitis and gram positive rod bacteremia.
.
#. Listeriosis - meningitis and bacteremia. Patient presented
with headache, nuchal rigidity, expressive aphasia, afebrile on
admission but temp to 104.4 in the ED, where she also started to
have rigors.  LP showed >300 WBC, poly predominant with 5%
monocytes, protein 152 glucose 16.  CSF gram stain showed gram
positive rods, blood culture grew gram positive rods, speciation
eventually grew listeria. Empiric treatment based on gram stain
was started: ampicillin and bactrim (to cover both nocardia and
question of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3**] below), vanc and ceftriaxone as well pending
confirmation of gram stain and culture results.  Once
speciations was confirmed, a five day course of gentamicin was
started for synergy, and vancomycin and ceftriaxone d/c'd.
Bactrim was maintained on treatment dose for concern for PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 4**] [**10-3**], when it was changed to prophylaxis dose.  Early on
admission, she developed hypotension that required levophed, but
was weaned off of pressors within the first couple of days of
admission with PRBCs (total of 4 units) and volume
resussitation.  Given bacteremia, TTE was done, no vegetations
or lesions noted. Head CT on admission showed right medial
frontal lobe likely infarct versus mass lesion, no hemorrhage.
Subsequent MRI confirmed infarct, unclear date, and EEG
consistent with meningitis.  Neurology was consulted, and the
patient was placed on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis given
meningoencephalitis. She spiked fevers to 101-102 over the first
several days of admission.  By [**10-1**], her neurological exam was
markedly improved, and by [**10-3**] her headache was gone, no
meningeal signs noted, although her baseline essential tremor
was slightly more severe. Surveillance blood cultures reamined
negative from [**9-29**] on.  Notably, she was transferred from ICU
to floor on [**10-3**], but noninvasive BP was read as 60/d, patient
mentating well, sent back to ICU. In the ICU, an arterial line
was placed, and consistently read 20-30 mmHg higher than
sphyngomanometer.  This discrepancy was of unclear etiology, but
persistent.  Patient maintained normal mentation, good urine
output, no tachycardia, and it was judged that, for some unclear
reason, the cuff pressures underestimated by 20-30 points.  On
[**10-5**], she was sent to the floor for further care and management.
.
#. Bilateral lung opacities/hypoxia. Initial chest film read as
increased opacities bilaterally concerning for PCP (given
steroids and no PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5**]) vs. bacterial pneumonia vs. pulmonary
edema. She had signifcant oxygen requirement, and her
respiratory distress led to her being placed on CPAP+PS.  The
origin of her significant hypoxia was originally thought to be
secondary to likely vascular leak from sepsis/CHF versus PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 6**]
induced sputum was attempted, but was unsuccessful, and was not
repeated initally given her unstable respiratory status, and
susbsequent evaluation that likelihood of PCP was small.  She
responded well to lasix diuresis, with reduced O2 requirements.
.
#. UC: She continued to receive her outpatient dose of
prednisone, which was changed on [**10-4**] to dexamethasone IV; her
outpatient 6-MP was held. After several days with no diarrhea,
it recurred on [**10-4**] soon after her diet had advanced. C.diff was
negative. She was made NPO, and fed via TPN for bowel rest.  On
[**10-6**], it was noted that she began passing BRBRP, her hematocrit
was noted to drop two points and pt was typed and crossed and
consent for blood transfusion.
.
#. Anemia. On admission, she was found to be anemic. She
received PRBCs for anemia on admission and again [**10-1**] for mixed
venous sat <70%.  She was found to have iron binding studies c/w
anemia of chronic disease.  Her HCT was followed closely, and
remained stable for the remainder of her admission.
.
#. FEN: Her diet was advanced as tolerated, but she was made NPO
with TPN on [**10-4**] after she developed diarrhea, thought secondary
to continued UC activity.
.
#. Prophylaxis: PPI. Hold SQ Hep, pneumoboots. Initially on
droplet precautions.
.
#. Code status: FULL
.
#. Communication: patient, her sister, brother, and mother
.
#. Lines: peripheral IV x 2. left subclavian CC.  A-line. Eval
for PICC; once in place, can d/c central line, a-line.

Surgery Discharge part:
Pt underwent total abdominal colectomy with ileoostomy on
[**2823-10-8**].  She was on Clinda/Gent peri-procedure and Amplicillin
for 21 days at first.  She was seen by PT/OT and was NPO until
the ostomy started to function.  SHe had c/o nausea as diet was
tolerated and it was slowed down.  MRI was suspicious for an
abcess and amplicillin was started for at least a total of 6
weeks as per ID.  She was given a PICC.  On [**10-17**] she was
cleared by PT and was in good condition for d/c to rehab on
[**2823-10-17**].

History of Present Illness:
61F w/ sign PMH for UC s/p colectomy, Stage II breast cancer
presented on day 13 of second cycle of chemotherapy with fever
to 100.6 at home w/ severe rigors. She took two Ibuprofen at
home and then went to onc clinic today where she was then
referred to the ED for admission. She stated that for the past
two days she has noticed an increasing amount of stool output in
her ostomy bag but denies abdominal discomfort or blood in her
stool. She has had nausea but similar to how she has felt in the
past with chemo. She also mentioned that she recently cut her
finger in the garden on Sunday which is now red and slightly
tender to the touch. She otherwise denies any vomiting, rash,
rhinorrhea, dysuria, cough, SOB or abdominal discomfort. She
denies any recent travel or sick contacts as well.

for WBC of 0.7 and PMN count of 21. Her U/A was bland and two
blood cultures were obtained and are pending. His CXR did not
show definitive source of infection either. She was started on
Cefepime for neutropenic fever. While in the ED she developed
hypotension not responding to IVF boluses, the pt denied CVL
placement and required the initiation of phenylepherine
peripherially in order to maintain SBPs in the 90s-100s. She did
not have a change in her mentation during these episodes of

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 14**] is a 61 yo w/ Stage II breast cancer who was
admitted on day 13 or cycle 2 of Docetaxel (Taxotere) +
Cyclophosphomide who developed fever to 100.6 at home with
associated rigors in the setting of neutropenia.
.
#Neutropenic Fever- On presentation the pt's PMN count was 21
most likely from her most recent chemotherapy cycle and lack of
Neulasta use. Two possible sources of infection existed
including pulmonary or from a laceration on her finger suffered
while gardening. She was broadly covered with Vancomycin and
cefepime to cover both possible sources, as well as flagyl to
cover for cdiff as the patient mentioned that she had increased
ostomy output.  When cdiff returned negative, flagyl was
discontinued. Blood cultures were sent and a U/A was not
concerning for infection. We also sent off galactomannan antigen
and beta-D-glucan labs initially as part of her neutropenic
fever workup which were negative. The following day after
admission her WBC rose significantly and she no longer was
neutropenic. As her WBC rose she started to develope a cough and
he CXR became concerning for an infiltrate. She was continued on
Vanc/Cefepime until afebrile and with ANC>1000 for greater than
48 hours, after which she was switched to PO levofloxacin to
complete an 8 day total course for community acquired pneumonia.
.
# Hypotension- In the [**Name (NI) **] pt's SBP dropped to 70s, not responding
to IVF boluses. She refused central line placement in the ED and
peripheral pressors were initiated. This is most likely related
to her underlying infectious process. She was not administered
any medications recently that could be accounting for her
hypotension. Looking through OMR her baseline blood pressures
are sbp of 90s-100s. An a-line was obtained which showed higher
BP than what was being recorded by the blood pressure cuff. She
was given several liters of IV fluid boluses and weaned off
pressors the night of admission to the ICU. Her cuff and a-line
pressures correlated after fluid resuscitation and the a-line
was discontinued.
.
# Breast Cancer- currently in cycle 2 of Docetaxel (Taxotere) +
Cyclophosphomide. Most likely this current episode of
neutropenia is due to the fact that Neulasta was not given
during this cycle of chemo per pt's request, however due to the
rapid rise in her WBC count myelosuppression from sepsis was
also a possibility.
.
# Depression / Anxiety- Continue Duloxetine and clonazepam at
home doses.
.
# Nausea- Continued compazine and PO zofran prn.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear [**Known patient firstname 17**],

It was a pleasure to take care of you here at [**Hospital1 18**]. You were
admitted for low white cell (neutrophil count), fever, and
pneumonia. You required monitoring with blood pressure
supporting medications and IV antibiotics in the intensive care
unit. Fortunately, your counts improved and you responded nicely
to the antibiotics. Please continue to take levofloxacin to
treat your pneumonia for a total of 8 days (last dose on
[**2830-3-19**]). As we discussed if you notice fever, worsening
breathing problems, or any other concerning symptoms to return
to the emergency room immediately.

We have made the following changes to your medications:

START levofloxacin 750mg by mouth daily for 4 more days
([**2830-3-19**])

You should discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19**] the possibility of restarting
neulasta with your next chemotherapy cycle.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 31**] is a 62 y.o. woman with primary progressive MS
[**Name13 (STitle) 32**] in [**2685**] with spasticity s/p intrathecal baclofen pump
placment in '[**06**], s/p tracheostomy in '[**07**] [**12-24**] to chronic
respiratory weakness, recurrent UTIs, aspiration PNAs, who
presents after being found to be febrile and unresponsive at her
nursing home.  According to notes from [**Hospital6 33**], the
pt was found at her nursing home yesterday ([**3-12**]) AM, shaking
her head repeatedly, subsequently becoming obtunded (presumed
seizure). She was taken by EMS to [**Hospital1 34**] ED.
.
In the ED at [**Name (NI) 34**], pts vitals were: Tm 103.6, HR 110-150s RR
12-18 SaO2 98-99%NRB. Soon after, pt supposedly seized in the
ED, was given Ativan, Ambu'd and subsequently placed on SIMV
ventilation. Pt was empirically started on Vancomycin, Levoquin,
Ceftriaxone, Bactrim and Acyclovir. On exam, it was noted that
the skin overlying the baclofen pump (RUQ) appeared inflamed.
Labs were notable for a WBC of 25 with 68%polys and a bandemia
of 20%. U/A with 50-100 WBC, +leukocyte esterase, +nitrite. LP
was performed and CSF analysis showed 7,250 WBCs with 92% polys,
glucose 10, TP 1440, and gm stain with many polys, few gm+
cocci. Bcx revealed gm+ cocci in chains in [**2-23**] bottles. Micro
lab performed latex agglutination on CSF sample which was
positive for group B strep. Vanc and Ceftriaxone were dc'd and
ampicillin 2gm IV + benadryl given. Hydrocortisone 80mg was also
given. Left SC line and NGT were also placed at [**Hospital1 34**]. CXR showed
cardiomegaly but no infiltrate. Abdominal CT was negative for an
abscess or fluid collection surrounding the pump. Head CT showed
questionable changes from prior that might suggest the
possibility of a right MCA infarct. Pt was transferred directly
to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for further management.


Past Medical History:
PMH:
1. Chronic progressive multiple sclerosis - dx'd in [**2685**] when pt
was 34 years old; on intrathecal baclofen pump ('[**06**]) for
spasticity
2. Recurrent UTIs and hosp. for urosepsis - thought [**12-24**] to
chronic indwelling Foley catheter for neurogenic bladder. Last
admitted [**Date range (3) 35**] for urosepsis
3. Recurrent aspiration PNA - [**2-/2704**], [**9-/2708**] - admitted both times
requiring MICU stay, during '[**07**] admission trach was placed
because was unable to clear secretions on her own [**12-24**] to
respiratory weakness
1/03 admitted for lingular PNA, unclear if [**12-24**] to aspiration
4. COPD
5. HTN
6. Osteoporosis
7. Scarlet fever as a child
8.  Chronic constipation
9. Hx of sacral decubitus ulcer

TTE on admission:
1. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal.
2. No obvious mass or vegetation seen.
.
CT abd post-op:
1) Large hematoma in the superficial tissues of the right upper
quadrant with associated edema and tracking into the abdominal
wall. No extension into the peritoneal space is seen. The
covering intern was notified by telephone at 10:30 a.m. on [**3-14**], [**2713**].

2) Gallbladder with dense material . this could represent
stones, sludge or vicarious excretion of iv contrast. If
clinically indicated, an ultrasound can be obtained for further
characterization.

3) Bilateral small kidneys with small nonobstructing stones.

4) Atelectasis and small pleural effusions at both lung bases.
.
EEG [**2714-3-14**]: This is a markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the

presence of generalized bursts of polymorphic disorganized
slowing
followed by periods of suppression. In addition, there were
independent
bifrontal sharp slow waves seen. This finding suggests deep,
midline
subcortical dysfunction and is consistent with a severe
encephalopathy.
A repeat EEG may be helpful to further evaluate the severity of
the encephalopathy.
.
EEG [**2714-3-17**]: This is an abnormal portable EEG obtained in stage
II sleep
with brief periods of drowsiness due to the presence of
intermittent and
independent shifting slowing in the parasagital region on both
sides.
This finding suggests deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and
is
consistent with the diagnosis of meningoencephalitis. In
addition,
exessive drowsiness was seen, perhaps also related to the
underlying
infection.
.
MRI [**3-21**]: Increased signal along the occipital horns could be
due to cellular debris from meningitis. No evidence of acute
infarct seen. Mild to moderate ventriculomegaly indicating mild
communicating hydrocephalus.
.
MRV [**3-21**]: The head MRV demonstrates normal flow signal in the
superior sagittal and transverse sinus without evidence of
thrombosis. Deep venous system also demonstrates normal flow
signal.
.
MRA [**3-21**]: Somewhat limited MRA of the head due to motion. No
evidence of vascular occlusion seen.
.
TEE:
1.The left atrium is normal in size.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4.There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
6.The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral
regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve.
7.There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
Head CT [**3-24**]: Stable appearance of the ventricles and sulci.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. GBS meningitis/bactermia
In the unit, the pt was continued on Ampicillin and started on
Gentamicin (for synergy). Her intrathecal baclofen pump was
thought to be infected (on exam, erythema and warmth overlying
pump in RUQ). Pt went to surgery to have pump removed and the
operation appeared to be without complication. The following
day, pt had 11 point hematocrit drop and was noted to be
hypotensive with an SBP of 70. After spiking a temp, it was
thought that she might be septic. She was given fluids, PRBCs,
FFP, and placed on Levophed. Abd CT demonstrated a 7 x 13x 11 cm
hematoma in the RUQ at the former pump site. Pt was taken
emergently to surgery where the hematoma was evacuated, slow
ooze noted, and the bleeding vessel cauterized. She returned to
the floor and remained hemodynamically stable. Given 1
additional unit of PRBCs. Her hct bumped appropriately and
remained in the high 20s for the rest of her unit course. Pt
developed erythematous macular rash on face, arms, knees thought
to be [**12-24**] to PCN allergy. Amp was d/c'd and replaced briefly
with Vanc and then changed permanently to Cefrtriaxone. Repeat
LP was performed since the pt continued to be minimially
responsive (withdrawing to pain, occ. opening eyes to name). CSF
analysis showed a resolving bacterial meningitis. Prior to
leaving the unit, pt spiked a temp to 101.2. She was pancultured
and all cultures were negative. A TTE ruled out endocarditis in
the setting of group B strep bacteremia.  On day #12 of
gentamycin, pt was changed to vanc/ceftaz for the completion of
her treatment course.
.
2. RUQ Hematoma: As above, after the removal of the baclofen
pump, pt had a hct drop and hypotensive episode and was found to
be bleeding into the RUQ pocket.  She was taken to the OR for
emergent evacuation of the hematoma.  On POD #16, pt was noted
to have oozing from the a site above the stitches in her RUQ.
Neurosurgery was reconsulted and they recommended an abdominal
ultrasound which showed vast improvement in the RUQ hematoma but
found a new fluid collection.  Surgery was consulted and they
diagnosed a seroma and recommended conservative management given
that it had no signs of infection.
.
3. Pneumonia:
Towards the end of the pt's ICU stay, she was evaluated by
speech and swallow and she had a very difficult time with the
passy-muir valve.  She underwent bronchoscopy and BAL was sent
for culture.  The culture returned positive for MRSA and gram
negative rods (not pseudomonas).  She was started on vancomycin
for MRSA and ceftaz/levaquin for double coverage of the GNR.
Once the GNR sensitivities showed that it was not pseudomonas,
ceftaz was stopped.  Of note, pt had vancomycin troughs that
were persistently high.  Vancomycin troughs should be checked
often and vanc should be adjusted for a level<15.  After the
pt's swallowing study, she was noted to have increased
secretions and some food particles were suctioned up so it was
assumed that the pt aspirated.  That day she also spiked a
temperature to 100 so Flagyl was added for anaerobic coverage.
Vancomycin and Levaquin will be finished on [**4-6**] (14-day course)
and Flagyl's course will be complete on [**4-10**] (after 10 days).
.
4. Supraglottic edema
As above, pt was evaluated by interventional pulmonary after she
failed a passy-muir valve.  On bronchoscopy it was noted that
she had severe supraglottic edema with grabulation tissue and
the vocal cords could only be minimally visualized.  She was
taken to the OR two days later for a rigid bronchoscopy where
her granulation tissue was debrided and a t-tube was placed.
ENT evaluated the patient and recommended a CT of the trachea to
evaluate her anatomy.  The CT showed tracheal bronchomalacia and
narrowing of the glottic and subglottic airway.  Ideally, she
will get surgery by ENT to improve her subglottic edema when the
patient has recovered from her acute illnesses.
.
5. Anemia: Iron studies indicate anemia of chronic disease.
Pt's baseline hct is between 26 and 29 and except for the hct
drop after the bleed in the RUQ pocket, pt's hct remained
stable.
.
6. Multiple sclerosis
Pt started on oral baclofen prior to pump removal. She was
without signs of baclofen withdrawal (i.e. incr HR, temp, BP,
seizures) once pump was removed. She continued on Baclofen 20mg
qid po with an Ativan taper. PO baclofen was then tapered to
20mg tid.
.
7. Mental status
At baseline, although pt is significantly debilitated by MS, she
is alert, oriented, and conversant. Her decreased responsiveness
was thought to be [**12-24**] to meningitis, but although pt seemed to
have resolving temp and WBC with Abx, her diminished
reponsiveness persisted. Repeat LP in the unit suggested a
resolving meningitis.  Neurology was following the pt and
recommended an MRI to rule out stroke (esp given her ? of stroke
at OSH) an MRV to rule out sinus thrombosis and an EEG to rule
out subclinical seizures.  An EEG on HD #3 was consistent with
severe encephalopathy and an EEG on HD #6 was consistent with
meningoencephalitis with no evidence of seizures.  An MRI was
finally done on HD #10 and showed mild communicating
hydrocephalus, no evidence of cavernous thrombosis or stroke.
Towards the end of her unit stay pt opened eyes to name and
eventually returned to her baseline mental status.  Pt's mental
status remained at baseline and pt will follow-up with neurology
as an outpatient.
.
8. Respiratory status
After a supposed seizure at OSH pt was mechanically ventilated
thru her trach site b/c no breath sounds were appreciated. (At
baseline, pt has respiratory weakeness 2/2 to multiple sclerosis
but does not require mechical ventilation. Trach in place to
help with clearance of secretions.)  Pt placed on A/C in unit,
then transferred to CPAP and eventually placed on a trach mask
with good results.  At time of discharge, she was satting well
on 40% trach mask.
.
9. HTN
In unit, pt initially normotensive, then mid-way through stay
became hypertensive with SBPs in the 150-170s. Pt has hx of
hypertension. Unclear whether BP was rebounding from baclofen
d/c. BP became well-controlled with systolic BP in the 90s-110s
on standing doses of Lisinopril 20mg po, Metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
10. Sacral decub ulcer: Stage 1-2.  Wound care nurse followed
while pt was in-house.
.
11. FEN: During pt's acute illness, she had an NGT placed.
Speech and swallow evaluated the pt and recommended thin liquids
and pureed food.  The following day, she was noted to have soup
coming out of her trach so she was again made NPO.  Pt then
passed the video swallow but again had some signs of aspiration
after trying some ground solids.  She was made NPO and GI placed
a PEG for feeding.  Pt should remain on tube feeds until her
tracheal swelling is much improved.  At that point, another
swallowing study can be performed and another trial of po
feeding.

Echo [**2678-10-7**]
Conclusions:
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include inferior and inferolateral
akinesis/hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of
[**2673-2-27**], left ventricular dysfunction is new and mild aortic
regurgitation
is now detected.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 63 yo male with cardiac arrest [**1-16**] paroxysmal high degree
AV block, s/p collapse with PEA arrest now with temp pacer
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further mgmt and permanent pacemaker
placement.
.
1. Rhythm: paroxysmal high degree block, temp pacer placed.
reasons for initial collapse are unclear, possibly combination
of high degree av block and electrolyte disturbances, since
patient was on many K+sparing diuretics.  Tele after admission
showed V-paced with few PVCs.  Pt underwent pacemaker placement
on [**2678-10-7**] without complications.  The next day device
interrigation was satisfacotory.  CXR did not show a
pneumothorax or any acute processes.  Pt remained without
complaints and was discharged on [**2678-10-8**].  Indications for
pacer was symptomatic with high degree block.
.
2. Coronaries: risk factors, [**Location (un) 47**] risk 17%, ruled out for
MI w/trop leak but flat CKs after arrest. -Cont ASA, BB, statin
- lipids checked : total chol 122, HDL 36, LDL 68.  Continued on
lipitor 20.
- initially held ACEI given [**Doctor First Name 48**] upto Creatinine of 2.2.  Given
his hyperkalemia on presentation pt was not restarted on ACE
inhibitors as his BP was well controlled.
- Repeat Echo (see below) showed EF of 50%.  Given this event
would recommend an outpatient evaluation by cardiologist for
likely exercise stress test.
.
3. Pump: EF [**2672**] was 60% w/LAE, likely diastolic dysfunction,
mild hypervolemia w/?mild pulm edema causing mild hypoxia,
initially gentle diuresis with goals -500cc to -1L.
- Continued amlodipine and metoprolol for rate control
- held ace/arbs due to [**Doctor First Name 48**]
- echo [**10-7**] showed EF of 50%.
- During the admission pt did not go onto complain any further
of Chest pain or Shortness of breath.
.
4. ARF/CRI: acute insult likely combo of triamterene and NSAIDS,
aggrevated by diuretics and ACE-I. Baseline 1.3-1.5 with
proteinuria long standing, should avoid NSAIDS for life.
-Discontinued ACE-I/ARBa and diuretics.
-Checked FeUrea, FeUrea: 36.5%, confirming ATN. spep and upep
(given anemia, pending), had u/s at [**Hospital1 46**] but should have
repeat as outpt to check complex cysts vs masses. Renal diet.
.
5. Anemia: new,  SPEP was negative, UPEP negative for bence
[**Doctor Last Name 49**] proteins,  and iron, shows anemia likely due to renal
causes
-PCP may consider [**Name9 (PRE) 50**] as outpt given pt's age and anemia.
.
6. Thombocytopenia: new, mild and stable during the admission.
.
7. Elevated glucose: possibly continued stress response, check
FS wnl.
.
8. h/o hypokalemia:  PCP may consider Nephrologist follow up.
Would Recommend outpt mineralocorticoid XS work-up once off K
sparing diuretics for a while.
.
9. Hip pain: awaiting THR. vicodin prn. No NSAIDs due to renal
problems.

Discharge Instructions:
You have had a pacemaker placed because of electrical block in
your heart. This may have been precipitated by kidney failure
and too much potassium in your blood. Do not take the
medications you were taking prior to this event. We have
enclosed a list of and prescriptions for your new medication
needs. Please take these as directed and discuss any changes
with your primary care doctor.
.
You have many risks for coronary heart disease. We feel you need
a stress test with imaging in the next month to make sure that
you do not have any significant need for a cardiac
catheterization. Until then, taking aspirin, your Toprol XL
(beta blocker safe in renal failure), your lipitor, and
eventually starting your lisinopril again will protect you
somewhat from heart attacks.
.
You must never take NSAID medications again. Your kidney disease
makes this dangerous. Avoid ibuprofen, advil, motrin, aleve,
naproxen, or ketoprofen. Talk with your doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 57**] if
you are unsure about any medications you are taking.


Followup Instructions:
1. See your primary care doctor Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 58**] on Friday 28th at
2:30pm, to check your potassium and creatinine levels and to
discuss everything we recommended. Have your doctor follow up on
the serum and urine protein electrophoresis that was pending
when you were discharged as well as the final report of your
echocardiogram. Talk with your doctor about your anemia and
whether or not you would need a bone marrow biopsy.

2. Go to the pacemaker DEVICE CLINIC Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 59**]
Date/Time:[**2678-10-14**] 11:30

3. You should see our nephrologists sometime for your kidney
disease. Talk with your primary doctor about this and call for
an appointment [**Telephone/Fax (1) 60**].

4. You should also setup an appointment with a cardiologist to
have a exercise stress test done as outpatient.  You can speak
with your PCP regarding [**Name Initial (PRE) **] cardiologist or you can call [**Hospital 61**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 62**] to setup an appointment here.

Pertinent Results:
CT head:
Extensive bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage. Recommend head CTA
to evaluate for an intracranial aneurysm.
Findings were discussed with Dr.

CTA:
FINDINGS: There is a 3 mm x 3 mm saccular outpouching from the
region of the anterior communicating artery (2:317), consistent
with aneurysm. This has a very narrow neck, and would be
amenable to endovascular intervention. No other aneurysm or
vascular abnormality is seen.
There is stenosis at the origin of the right vertebral artery.
Otherwise, the carotid and vertebral arteries and their major
branches are patent, with no evidence of stenosis or occlusion.
The distal cervical internal carotid arteries measure 5 mm on
the right, and 5 mm on the left.
Mild-to-moderate multilevel cervical spine degenerative changes
are noted.
IMPRESSION: 3 mm saccular aneurysm arising from the anterior

artery, with narrow neck.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 83**] was admited on [**2632-3-4**] and became increasingly
lethargic and transferred to the ICU for further care under the
Neurosurgery service. A diagnostic CTA revealed a large ACOM
aneursym which was coiled the following day.

Post Coiling the pt. was admitted to the ICU with a ventricular
drain. There were no incidences of increased intracranial
pressure or decline. A cerebral perfusion study performed [**3-7**]
confirmed the lack of vasospasm and develoing strokes.

He had some R shoulder weakness and shoulder X-ray was
concerning for rotator cuff injury and orthopedics was
consulted.

On [**2636-3-8**]/14/15 his ventricular drain was clamped and reopened
due to elevated ICP levels. On [**3-11**] he was transferred to the
SDU and continued to remain stable.  He had his ventricular
drain clamped on [**3-13**] and after 48 hours of the clamping trial
he had a CT done which was stable without any evidence of
hydrocephalus. At this time the drain was pulled.

He was placed on a fluid restriction for a brief period of time
for a drop in his Na level, and also on salt tabs, upon
discharge to rehab we have removed the fluid restriction, but we
are continuing the salt tabs, we advise that the Na level be
checked every other day, and the salt tabs may be d/c'ed when Na
is stable on serial checks. Upon discharge his Na is 138.

He is now ready for discharge to rehab.

On discharge his exam is as follows:

Alert and Oriented X2
Moving all extremities with full strength
slight Right Drift, which has been persistant throughout his
hospitalization, and possibly secondary to a rotator cuff
injury.

Pertinent Results:
CT head [**3005-12-31**]:
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or major cortical
territorial infarction.

CXR [**3005-12-31**]:
: New right lower lobe confluent opacity which may represent a
developing area of pneumonia. Differential diagnosis includes
aspiration and
atelectasis. Dedicated PA and lateral chest radiograph is
suggested for more
complete characterization when the patient's condition permits.

no contrast head CT [**3006-1-6**]
 FINDINGS: There has been interval development of an area of
decreased attenuation at the left basal ganglia and
periventricular white matter in the distribution of the left
lenticulostriate artery consistent with a subacute infarct.
There is associated swelling with mass effect on the left
lateral ventricle. There is no shift of normally midline
structures. Additional areas of hypodensity in the
periventricular white matter and right centrum semiovale are
unchanged and consistent with old infarctions. Two calcified
meningiomas are again seen arising at the left frontal dura and
anterior olfactory groove. They are unchanged from prior study.
No intracranial hemorrhage was identified. Surrounding osseous
and soft-tissue structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Subacute left lenticulostriate infarction which was
not present on head CT of [**3005-12-31**]

echo [**3006-1-6**]:

The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular  hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal  technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.  Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is a
severe resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right
ventricular  chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve is not well  seen. There is probably mild aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is  seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral  regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
There is a significant  left ventricular inflow gradient which
may be due to mitral annular  calcification and mitral valve
calcification. The tricuspid valve leaflets are  mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

LENI [**3006-1-2**]:
No evidence of thrombus within the right upper extremity

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted with hypernatremia and acute mental status
changes and right sided paralysis. Her corrected sodium on
admission was about 170s and her free water deficit was 5.5L.
She was volume repleted with normal saline. She also recieved
D51/4 NS for free water repletion initially and this was changed
to free water boluses through nasogastric tube. Her sodium
gradually trended down with free water repletion. She also was
in pre-renal renal failure and her creatinine trended down with
hydration.

With regards to the acute mental changes, this is partially
explained by the hypernatrmic state. However, she was also noted
by the nursing home to have right sided weakness. CT head was
performed on admission which was negative for stoke. Neurology
was consulted and found that she has a MCA territory stroke by
exam. A repeat CT head was performed on [**1-6**] which showed
watershed infarct. TTE which was also obtained did not reveal
any thrombus.Per neurology recommendation, all her hypertensive
medication has been discontinued and she was started on aspirin.


Chest XRay on admission was concerning for right lower lobe
pneumonia. Her sputum culture grew MSSA for which she was on
oxacillin. Levofloxacin was also started for community acquired
pneumonia. Nasal aspirate was sent for influenza and was
negative. She was intubated on [**3006-1-2**] for increased respiratory
effort. Her resporatory decompensation was likely from
aspiration pneumonia. She was extubated on [**3006-1-9**] when her
lungs mechanic improved. However, given her  depressed mental
status and stroke, she was not able to clear her secretions
well. SHe was intubated again on [**1-11**] after unsuccessful attempt
to maintain her oxygen saturation with high flow mask. She
recieved tracheostomy and G tube and tolerated well post
procedure.

Her  nutrition status was maintained by tubefeeds and insulin
sliding scale and NPH kept her glucose within range.

Her blood pressure was initially low on admission. This
responded well to hydration and brief use of levophed. Her [**Last Name (un) 103**]
stimulation test was responsive. Admission EKG showed ST
depression in V2-V3 and it was unsure if this is old. She had
slightly elevated troponin, likely from acute renal failure
which eventually trending down.

Plastic surgery was consulted for decubitus ulcer. No
debridement was indicated and their recommendation was to
maxmize nutrition, wet to dry dressing and tight glucose
control.

She remained on sc heparin, lansoprazole, pneumoboots and bowel
regimen as part of her porphylaxis. She had picc line placed
upon discharge

THere had been multiple discussion with her daughter, which is
her health care proxy regarding code status. It was felt by the
medical team that her condition will not likely improve despite
optimal medical treatment. However, due to religious reasons,
her family remained steadfast that everything should be done.
However, her family agrees that should she go into cardiac
arrest, there should be no chest compression or defibrillation.

Pertinent Results:
Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**5-/3259**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Limited coronary angiography demonstrated heavily calcified
left
main, left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries. The
left circumflex had a heavily calcified proximal lesion.
2. LV ventriculography was deferred.
3. Successful Rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the
proximal left circumflex artery with a Cypher (3x13mm) drug
eluting stent postdilated to 3.5mm. Final angiography
demonstrated no
angiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis and
TIMI III flow throughout the vessel (See PTCA Comments).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the
proximal LCX with a drug eluting stent (Cypher).

Left axis deviation. Secondary repolarization abnormalities.
Compared to the
previous tracing of [**3259-7-19**] heart rate has increased. Otherwise,
no major
change.

CXRs over the course of admission showed slowly improving
pulmonary edema, no major focal consolidations were seen.
.
Renal US - no hydronephrosis, patent renal artery.

Brief Hospital Course:
# PUMP/Chronic systolic congestive heart failure:
Patient presented with presumed acute exacerbation of chronic
systolic heart, which has improved after ultrafiltration. [**Date Range **]
with EF of 30-40% unchanged from prior. She currently appears
fairly euvolemic, however her fluid status has remained
difficult to manage given her low ejection fraction and poor
urine output.
- Continued home doses of carvedilol and losartan.  Were held
initially for low blood pressures, but both restarted during her
admission.
- Hemodialysis was considered for fluid managment, but a trial
of lasix proved successful.  She will now go home on 160 mg PO
daily lasix and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 117**], her nephrologist.
She will monitor daily weights/low sodium diet, pt had nutrition
consult during stay.
.
# CAD: No evidence ACS during hospitalization. Patient is s/p
recent LCx stent.  She was continued on ASA, carvedilol, plavix,
and Losartan.

.
#. Valves. No active issues. Severe AS a/p valvuloplasty
[**3259-6-25**], stable AS per [**Month/Day/Year **]. Discussed with patient and family:
per their report, patient was previously evaluated by Dr.
[**Name (NI) 136**] in cardiac surgery and was not a candidate for valve
replacment due to ""calcifications."" Patient may be candidate for
new cath-assisted valve replacement. Also has mild MR on last
[**Name (NI) 112**].  Pt should likely be re-evaluated after discharge.
.
# Respiratory distress resolved -
Respiratory distress was suspected to be likely multifactorial
secondary to volume overload and also PNA as supported by
elevated WBC on presentation, fever, and now GNR in sputum gram
stain but not growing on culture. Increased sputum overnight
while afebrile, non-elevated white count likely represents
resolving infection. Received monotherapy with ceftazadime only
given GNR in sputum may be pseudomonas; antibiotics started
[**7-13**], continued for 7 days.  She will continue lasix as
outpatient to try and prevent pulm edema.
.
# ANEMIA/GIB:
HCT drop was noted several two days into admission, unclear if
represented true blood loss. NGT removed [**7-15**] and this
demonstrated frank dark blood (+hemoccult) in NGT, likely
representing bleed several days ago from gastritis. LDH and
haptoglobin were checked with HCT drop and were within normal
limits which is inconsistent with hemolysis. She received 1 u
PRBCs soon after admission, and HCT has remained stable since.
Her Hcts were between 26 and 28.  Stools were checked for guiac,
and were positive two days prior to dicharge.  We discharged her
home with protonix and recommend follow up with her PCP to
continue to monitor CBCs for watch for blood loss.  She is not
actively losing blood as seen by her stable Hcts.  We also
recommend an outpatient colonoscopy.  Although, she needs to be
very careful with the bowel prep, as that can cause large fluid
shifts and drive her into pulmonary edema.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure (stable Cr):
Acute on chronic renal failure likely due to ATN secondary to
hypotension versus ongoing pre-renal state. Patient had been
initiated on HD in [**3259-4-29**]; was taken off HD ~1 week prior to
admission. Volume overload/CHF on admission, improved with UF,
now appears euvolemic. Creatinine 1.... on discharge.  Pt has
history of RCC with nephrectomy.  Renal function has seemed to
normalize.  Will continue follow up with nephrologist and he
will also coordinate removal of dialysis catheter.

#  Pt was discharge to home with services for PT and home health
care for dialysis catheter dressing changes.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for respiratory distress due to fluid in your
lungs from an acute episode of worsening heart failure.  You
were intubated at the time, and when you were able to breath on
your own, we continued to remove fluid from your lungs with
diuretics.  We also are continuing to give you the medicines
carvedilol and losartan for your heart failure.

You also will start taking lasix daily to ensure fluid stays off
your lungs.

In addition, you had acute renal failure during this admission.
Your kidney function improved, but you will continue to need
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 117**].  You also have a dialysis catheter in
your chest that will need to be taken care of by a home nurse.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 117**] will discuss removal of the catheter as an
outpatient.

We also found a trace amount of blood in your stool.  You should
meet with your PCP and discuss having a colonoscopy.  Make sure
to tell them you have heart failure because it does affect the
bowel preparation they plan for you.

Once at home, weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 137**] MD if weight >
3 lbs.
Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet.  Call the nutritionist with any
questions.

Also, if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest

Service:  Medicine [**Hospital1 138**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
female who has a past medical history significant for
coronary artery disease, hypertension, dementia, recurrent
pneumonia and recent gastrectomy for peptic ulcer disease,
who presented to the emergency room with a complaint of
increasing shortness of breath.  The patient had been at home
for approximately 2 days following discharge from rehab
following gastrectomy when shortness of breath developed.
Emergency medical services were called and the patient was
found to have an oxygen saturation of 65% on room air and 85%
on 100% non-re-breather.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypothyroid.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Peptic ulcer disease status post gastrectomy for
perforated ulcer.
5.  Dementia.
6.  Esophageal motility disorder.
7.  Recurrent pneumonia.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Living situation - the patient at baseline
resides at home with 24 hour home health assistance.  There
is extensive family involvement.  The patient's code status
is DNR, DNI.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aricept 10 mg.
2.  Lasix 40 mg.
3.  Prevacid 30 mg.
4.  Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d.
5.  Multi-vitamin.
6.  Effexor 70 mg.
7.  Prednisone 25 mg.
8.  Zofran p.r.n.
9.  Synthroid 15 mg.

EXAM:  On presentation to the emergency department the
patient was found to have vital signs as follows:
Temperature 98.7, heart rate 82, blood pressure 160/62,
respiratory rate 25, oxygen saturation 87% on room air.  In
general, the patient is a well nourished but thin female in
respiratory distress.  There was no jugular venous distention
on examination of the neck.  Lung exam revealed decreased
breath sounds bilaterally.  Cardiovascular exam was
unremarkable.  The PEG site was clean, dry and intact.  The
patient was alert and oriented only to person.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  Admission CBC was unremarkable.
Admission SMA-7 was significant for an elevated BUN to
creatinine ratio consistent with dehydration.  Urinalysis was
unremarkable.  Cardiac enzymes were significant for an
isolated elevated troponin.  Coagulation studies were
unremarkable.  Arterial blood gas on 100% oxygen was
significant for a decreased pO2 of 70 and an elevated pCO2 of
59 with a normal pH.

RADIOLOGY:  Chest x-ray on admission revealed mild congestive
heart failure, markedly improved since the prior study of
[**2833-10-2**].  There was also bilateral lower lobe
opacification concerning for pneumonia.  CT angiogram
revealed consolidations at both lung bases consistent with
bibasilar pneumonia as well as subtle patchy opacifications
in the upper lobes with air fluid levels in the esophagus
suggesting possible aspiration.  There was no evidence of
pulmonary embolism.

CARDIAC STUDIES:  EKG on admission revealed sinus rhythm with
mild left axis deviation.  There was also felt to be possible
left anterior fascicular block.  The admitting MICU team
noted possible ST elevations in V3 through V6.
Echocardiogram revealed mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal left ventricular cavity size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function was normal.  There
was normal right ventricular systolic function.  There was
also moderate aortic regurgitation.  No pericardial effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Respiratory distress:  On admission, the patient was felt
to have bilateral pneumonia, most likely secondary to
aspiration.  The patient was started on IV Levaquin, Flagyl
and Vancomycin to cover for likely aspiration in a setting of
recent nursing home admission.  The patient was kept on
supplemental oxygen to keep oxygen saturations above 92% and
was kept NPO on aspirations precautions.  On day of admission
antibiotics were changed to IV ceftazidine, Flagyl and
Vancomycin.  Vancomycin was dosed at 1 gram q24 hours in the
setting of patient's decreased renal function, age and body
size.  On day two of admission the patient was also felt to
be fluid over loaded and gentle diuresis was resumed.  On day
two of admission the patient was felt to be stable for
transfer to the floor.  On the floor, the patient was
initially continued on IV antibiotics.  On day five of
admission the patient had a follow up chest x-ray which
revealed marked improvement in bibasilar pneumonia.  The
patient also had improvement in oxygen saturation and was
able to tolerate room air.  As a result, the patient was
transitioned to p.o. antibiotics and was given Augmentin and
Flagyl through the PEG tube.  The patient was discharged home
on hospital day 9 with instructions to complete a 14 day
course of p.o. antibiotics for presumed aspiration pneumonia.

2.  Cardiovascular:  Elevated troponin as well as possible ST
elevations on admission were felt to reflect a demand
ischemia.  Cardiac enzymes and EKG changes stabilized.  The
patient was continued on aspirin, Lopressor throughout the
admission.  On day three of admission the patient had an
episode of sinus tachycardia likely secondary to dehydration
versus multi-focal atrial tachycardia secondary to pulmonary
disease.  This resolved following hydration.  The patient's
cardiovascular function remained stable for the rest of the
admission.

3.  Dementia:  The patient was continued on Aricept
throughout the admission.

4.  Gastrointestinal:  Following rehydration, the patient was
found to have a mildly decreased hematocrit.  As a result,
the patient was received an elevation by gastroenterology to
look for gastrointestinal bleeding as an etiology of
decreased hematocrit.  Given the patient's history of peptic
ulcer disease, gastroenterology service recommended H. pylori
serology, which was negative.  Iron studies were sent, which
revealed a decreased total iron binding capacity as well as
decreased iron suggestive of a combination of both blood loss
and chronic disease as etiologies of anemia.
Gastroenterology service felt, however, that EGD and
colonoscopy were not an option in setting of patient's recent
ischemic cardiac disease.  Furthermore, the patient refused
gastroenterology work up.  Gastroenterology service also
asked to evaluate patient for possible contribution of reflux
of jejunostomy tube feedings to development of aspiration
pneumonia.  Gastroenterology service felt that reflux of
J-tube feedings was unlikely, however, felt that patient's
long history of esophageal dysmotility could be contributing
to aspiration.  They recommended swallowing study.  The
patient received an oropharyngeal video fluoroscopic
swallowing evaluation on day five of admission.  This
revealed mild oral with moderate to severe pharyngoesophageal
dysphagia with significant impaired upper esophageal
sphincter opening leading to severe residue of solids in the
pharynx.  However, there was no aspiration.  Nevertheless,
swallowing service recommended the patient in future have
only thin liquids, pureed solids or very finely/minced meat
in p.o. diet.  They also recommended that the patient sit
bolt upright at meals and for 45 minutes after meals.  They
recommended the patient remain at 45 degrees in bed at all
times and should never lay flat in bed and recommended that
if patient must remain flat in bed that tube feedings be
discontinued for 30 minutes prior to patient laying flat in
bed.

5.  Endocrine:  The patient was continued on Levothyroxine
for hypothyroidism.

6.  GU:  The patient was placed on Foley catheter on
admission to the hospital.  On day seven of admission the
patient was ready for discharge from a medical standpoint,
but did not void in time status post discontinuation of the
Foley catheter.  As a result the patient remained in-house
for an additional day to ensure the patient could void
spontaneously following discontinuation of Foley catheter.

POST DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Metronidazole 500 mg q8 hours x7
days, Augmentin 500/125 mg p.o. b.i.d. x7 days, furosemide 40
mg p.o. q.d., aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., metoprolol 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Venlafaxine HCL 75 mg capsule p.o. q.d.,
Levothyroxine 150 mcg p.o. q.d., donepezile hydrochloride 10
mg p.o. q.h.s., Lansoprazole 30 mg q.d., iron sulfate 325 mg
p.o. q.d., multi-vitamin.

DISPOSITION:  To home with visiting nurse as well as 24 hour
home health assistance.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  On day of discharge, the patient was
ambulating, voiding spontaneously and had oxygen saturation
of 97% on two liters.  The patient was demented in a manner
consistent with baseline.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Aspiration pneumonia.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Peptic ulcer disease status post gastrectomy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61-year-old male with
a past medical history significant for right upper lobe small
cell cancer stage III, status post chemotherapy and
radiation, status post right upper lobe sleeve resection
[**6-14**], also with past medical history significant for diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, prostate cancer status post radical
prostatectomy, GERD, TIA 15 years ago, gout and COPD. The
patient has no known drug allergies.  The patient is status
post right upper lobe lung sleeve resection on [**6-14**] for small
cell lung cancer.  The patient was discharged home doing well
until four days prior to admission when he presented to the
Emergency Room with shortness of breath and fevers.  The
patient was given Levaquin and was then discharged home
again.  He continued having shortness of breath and
productive cough.  He was admitted [**7-6**] for a follow-up
bronchoscopy during which time they found a right middle lobe
obstruction secondary to swelling.  After the procedure the
patient had shortness of breath with an oxygen saturation of
88 as well as rigors and chills.  The patient was also found
to have poor color.  The patient's O2 saturation improved.
Chest x-ray was obtained and the patient was admitted.  The
patient underwent surgery [**2534-7-10**].  The patient underwent
completion pneumonectomy, bronchoscopy and serratus flap
closure of right main stem bronchus.

Postoperative day #1 the patient was afebrile with heart rate
of 56, blood pressure 104/56, satting at 99%.  Chest tube

pending.  Physical exam was benign.  Plan was to administer
Lasix today after transfer to the floor.  Infectious disease
came by to see the patient postop day #2 as well because they
were requested to recommend an antibiotic for the right
infiltrate to prevent the possibility of a postoperative
empyema.  Their recommendation was to continue with the
current IV antibiotics.  Clindamycin and Ceftriaxone will be
present. In the remote chance of postoperative infection
empyema these antibiotics will be present in the cavity and
also by peripheral circulation.

Postoperative day #3, events over the last 24 hours include

.5, glucose 141.  Physical exam was benign.  Plan was to
check the PT, PTT and to get a chest x-ray today and to
continue 20 mg of Lasix.  ID came by to see the patient again
today at which time they stated that the patient is already
on broad coverage for the lung abscess.  Strep and staff
improving, the tubes will be discontinued after the
antibiotics.  Follow-up of sensitivities on the culture and

emboli in the left lung, patient on Heparin.  ID again came
by to see the patient at which time they stated that the
patient was clinically stable from an ID perspective and to
continue the antibiotic regimen for a total of 14 days.  If
the patient spikes a fever they were to be consulted again.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61 year old man
with a history of stage III squamous lung carcinoma, status
post lobectomy and pneumonectomy on the right earlier this
year, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 186**] for respiratory failure.  Two weeks prior to
admission, the patient began experiencing episodes of
shortness of breath, cough and dyspnea.  Echocardiogram and
electrocardiogram performed at that time were reportedly
unremarkable.

On [**2534-9-12**], after coming home from his son's wedding, the
patient became acutely short of breath, agitated and
collapsed on the floor, stating that he could not breathe.
His family called 911 and the patient was intubated in the
field and taken to [**Hospital 187**] Hospital where a chest x-ray was
reportedly normal but electrocardiogram showed transient new
left bundle branch block, ST elevations in leads II through
V4 and Q waves in the anterior precordial leads, all of which
was new.  He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] and Coronary Care Unit for further evaluation
and management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Stage III-A squamous cell lung carcinoma, status post
right pneumonectomy, chemotherapy and radiation.
2.  Transient ischemic attack.
3.  Pulmonary embolism.
4.  Atrial fibrillation, on Amiodarone.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has a sister who died of cancer
at the age of 39, and an older brother status post coronary
artery bypass graft.  His father also had coronary artery
disease and a sister has cardiac valve disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient quit smoking three months ago
following three to four packs per day times forty years.  He
consumed two to three drinks per day.  He is a construction
worker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature is 99, heart
rate 70 to 80s, blood pressure 110/60, oxygen saturation 95%.
In general, the patient was intubated and sedated.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat examination indicated the pupils
2.0 millimeters and reactive bilaterally.  Endotracheal tube
is in place.  Cardiovascular - tachycardia with no murmurs,
rubs or gallops.  Pulmonary examination - The patient had
diffuse coarse rhonchi on the left and absent breath sounds
on the right.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended
with normal bowel sounds.  The extremities were warm with 1+
distal pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:  Initial laboratory studies at the outside
hospital indicated that he had a white blood cell count of
11.4, hematocrit 41.0, platelets 466,000.  The differential
on the white blood cell count was 74% polys, 15% lymphocytes,
and 8% monocytes.  Chem7 indicated a sodium of 136, potassium
5.0, chloride 96, bicarbonate 35, blood urea nitrogen 12,
creatinine 1.3, glucose 285.  Prothrombin time was 22.4,
partial thromboplastin time 37.4, INR 3.0.  Arterial blood
gases indicated a pH of 7.29, paCO2 of 54, paO2 of 506 on a
100% FIO2.  Urinalysis was within normal limits.  CKs were 41
and 57 with a troponin of 0.04 and then 0.6.

Chest x-ray indicated status post right pneumonectomy with no
infiltrate and mild vascular engorgement.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit where he later ruled in for myocardial infarction
with a peak troponin of 4.5 and flat CKs.  A Transesophageal
echocardiogram indicated an ejection fraction of 25% and
apical hypokinesis.  The patient was also noted to develop
new onset rapid atrial fibrillation with associated
hypotension and was cardioverted to normal sinus rhythm but
remained hypotensive requiring pressors.  A CT angiogram was
performed to rule out pulmonary embolism, which was negative.

On [**2534-9-14**], a PA catheter was inserted which indicated
decreased central venous pressure and decreased pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure consistent with septic shock.  The
patient concurrently developed a temperature to 100 to 101
while urine culture grew E. coli.  The patient was started on
intravenous Levofloxacin, Vancomycin and Tobramycin and
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he
received intravenous fluids and was changed from Levophed to
vasopressin with good effect.  On [**2534-9-16**], the pressors were
weaned.

Bronchoscopy was performed which indicated intact suture
sites with some thick secretions.  On [**2534-9-17**], the patient
was successfully extubated.  Over the weekend of [**2534-9-18**],
and [**2534-9-19**], the patient defervesced with decreasing white
blood count and was successfully switched to oral medications
with stable blood pressure.  His antibiotics other than
Levaquin were discontinued.  The patient was then transferred
to the C-Medicine service for workup of coronary artery
disease.

Cardiac catheterization indicated 30% mid right coronary
artery stenosis and mild irregularities in the left anterior
descending and left circumflex arteries with a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 60%.  The patient was
titrated up on a beta blocker ace inhibitor.  Lipid panel
indicated a total cholesterol of 201, triglycerides of 137,
LDL of 133 and HDL of 41.  He was therefore started on statin
therapy for hypercholesterolemia.

The patient was worked up for anemia with hematocrit in the
30.0s during his stay in the C-Medicine service and was found
to have an iron of 22, ferritin of 459, TIBC of 228,
transferrin of 175. These findings were consistent with
anemia of chronic disease and thought secondary to his lung
cancer.

On the C-Medicine service, the patient was noted to have
bilateral carotid bruits.  Carotid Doppler studies were
performed which indicated less than 40% bilateral stenosis
and mild plaquing bilaterally.

The patient was maintained on Heparin during his hospital
course and started on Coumadin two days prior to anticipated
discharge with plan to discharge to home on Lovenox until the
patient reached a therapeutic INR of 2.0 to 3.0.

From an endocrine perspective, the patient was treated with
regular insulin sliding scale for his diabetes mellitus with
a plan to transition back to his home regimen of Glyburide 5
mg p.o. q.d.  Fingerstick blood sugar indicated good glycemic
control during hospital course.

A physical therapy consultation was arranged and at the time
of discharge dictation, it was anticipated that the patient
would be deemed safe for discharge to home with outpatient
physical therapy follow-up.

At the time of dictation, the patient was planned to be
discharged to home with VNA.  He was also to follow-up in [**Hospital 189**]
Clinic for an INR check on the day following discharge and
was to follow-up with his primary care physician in [**Name9 (PRE) 189**] firm.
He was to complete a fourteen day course of Levaquin, which
had been switched to p.o. on the day prior to his discharge
in order to treat his urinary tract infection.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Urosepsis.
2.  Acute myocardial infarction, status post cardiac
catheterization indicating 30% mid right coronary artery
stenosis and mild irregularities in the left anterior
descending and left circumflex.
3.  Stage III-A squamous cell lung carcinoma, status post
right pneumonectomy.
4.  Atrial fibrillation, status post cardioversion to normal
sinus rhythm.
5.  Prostate cancer, status post radical prostatectomy.
6.  Diabetes mellitus.

DISPOSITION:  On discharge, it is anticipated at the time of
dictation that the patient will be discharged to home with
VNA and will require outpatient physical therapy.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Enteric Coated Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q.d. for a total course of fourteen
days.
3.  Coumadin 3 mg p.o. q.h.s.
4.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.h.s.
8.  Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q4-6hours p.r.n.
9.  Ambien 10 mg p.o. q.h.s.
10. Oxygen four liters nasal cannula.
11. Lovenox 80 mg subcutaneous b.i.d. until INR is greater
than 2.0.
12. Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizer treatments q4hours
p.r.n.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year-old
male with a past medical history of squamous cell lung cancer
treated with right total pneumonectomy, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease on 2 to 3 liters of home oxygen with
saturations in the low 90s at baseline, congestive heart
failure, and diabetes mellitus type 2 who was recently
admitted from [**7-11**] to [**2535-7-15**] for presumed
bronchitis or bronchiectasis flare here with recurrent cough,
shortness of breath and fevers.  During his last admission
two weeks ago he was treated for chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease flare versus bronchitis with a ten day
Prednisone taper and Augmentin for one week.  He underwent
bronchoscopy due to concern for possible endobronchial
lesion, which was normal.  Sputum sample was done at that
time showed no growth.  He was discharged at his baseline
function on [**2535-7-15**].  The plan was to treat him for one
week of Augmentin, skip one week followed by Bactrim for one
week, skip one week and then on Augmentin for two weeks for
pneumonia prophylaxis.  The last dose of Augmentin was
[**2535-7-18**] after being on Augmentin for only three days.

He was doing well until approximately one week ago when he
developed mild spasms in the afternoon that he thought was
due to low potassium.  Within the following days he
complained of worsening cough productive of clear sputum.  He
had a low grade temperature, mild headache and worsening
cough and presented to the Emergency Department.  He denied
any sinus pain, sore throat, chest pain, abdominal pain,
diarrhea, dysuria or joint pain.  In the Emergency Department
he was febrile to 102 orally and had a heart rate of 160 and
a blood pressure of 118/56.  Respiratory rate 28.  Sating 88
to 98% on 100% nonrebreather.  Initially he was stable, but
then had a gradual change in mental status with hypoxia,
which resulted in his elective intubation.  He received Lasix
100 mg intravenous twice, 1 mg of Bumex and 1 gram of
Ceftriaxone as well as 125 mg of Solu-Medrol.  He was also
placed on a heparin drip for a subtherapeutic INR and given
morphine and Ativan for sedation.  Chest x-ray showed no
focal pneumonia or evidence of heart failure.  The patient
then underwent a CT angiogram of the chest that showed no
evidence of pulmonary embolism.

10 mg q.d., Ambien 15 mg q.h.s. and a regular insulin sliding
scale.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient quit smoking in [**2534-5-23**]
following a forty year history of smoking three to four packs
a day.  He consumed two to three drinks alcoholic drinks per
day and was a construction worker.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has a sister who died of cancer
at the age of 39 and an older brother who had a coronary
artery bypass graft.  His father also had coronary artery
disease and he had a sister with cardiac valvular disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This was a gentleman who was
intubated, sedated and responsive only to noxious stimuli.
Pupils were unremarkable.  There were no bruits in the neck.
Heart had a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2
sounds, faint heart sounds overall.  Occasional ectopic
beats. Lungs were clear to auscultation on the left with
transmitted breath sounds on the right.  Abdomen was soft and
mildly distended with decreased bowel sounds.  Extremities
showed no evidence of ulcers, trace edema in both lower
extremities and no cyanosis or clubbing.  Skin showed no
evidence of rashes.

LABORATORY EXAMINATION:  Urinalysis was unremarkable.  White
blood cell count 23, hematocrit 42, platelets were 297.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Upon admission to the hospital the patient
was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he
was treated for presumed bronchitis versus tracheobronchitis
versus atypical pneumonia.  Blood sputum, urine and stool
cultures were sent and Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin were
started.

1.  Infectious disease:  The patient did not develop a focal
infiltration throughout his hospitalization.  His Ceftriaxone
was stopped and he was continued on Azithromycin.  He
remained afebrile throughout the rest of his hospital stay
and his white blood cell count decreased daily.  On hospital
day two he was stable for extubation and tolerated extubation
very well.  He was then transferred on hospital day number
three out of the Intensive Care Unit to the medical floor.
He continued to improve clinically with a decrease in his
fever curve and decrease in his oxygen requirements.  He also
subjectively improved and on his last hospital day he was
comfortable and ambulating without oxygen.  He stated that he
had come back to his baseline.  White blood cell count
returned to [**Location 210**] range, and cultures were negative except
for one anaerobic bottle that was growing gram positive
coxae that had been unidentified by the time of discharge.

2.  Pulmonary:  This was treated as possible
tracheobronchitis versus chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease versus atypical pneumonia.  The patient was kept on
his usual inhaler and nebulizing medications as well as
Azithromycin and intravenous Solu-Medrol.  After hospital day
number two and the patient was extubated and improving the
Solu-Medrol was switched to Prednisone and was rapidly
tapered.  The patient was encouraged to ambulate and was
given regular respiratory treatment and chest physical
therapy.  By the end of the hospitalization the patient felt
that he had returned to his baseline lung function, baseline
pulmonary function and was coughing up less dark sputum.  To
manage his congestive heart failure Lasix was used
judiciously in order to gently diurese him over the course of
the hospitalization followed by urine output and daily
weights.  The patient responded to this well and felt overall
that his symptoms of volume overload had improved.

3.  Cardiovascular:  Based on his presentation, it was not
clear that there was not a cardiac component causing his
change in his status, so cardiac enzymes were sent.  Three
sets of enzymes were negative and showed no evidence of
myocardial infarction.  He had a number of electrocardiograms
that were checked to ensure that he did not have a
significantly prolonged QTC interval and that it was not
worse.

4.  Endocrine:  The patient was followed with blood glucose
measurements that showed that his glucose was under poor
control with the Glyburide and the regular insulin sliding
scale.  As the regular insulin sliding scale was increased
and the Prednisone was tapered these values returned closer
to normal.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Improved.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  1.  Humibid LA 600 mg b.i.d.  2.
Lasix 160 mg b.i.d.  3.  Potassium 40 milliequivalents po

home for pulmonary physical therapy and O2 assistance and so
this was arranged on an outpatient basis, with chest physical
therapy and incentive spirometry and other pulmonary
treatments.  The plan was that he would follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic the following week and that he would have
an INR drawn on [**8-2**] calling the results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory distress.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62-year-old
male with a past medical history significant for lung cancer
status post right pneumonectomy in [**2534-6-23**], six
hospitalizations since [**2535-5-23**], last discharged on
[**2535-7-31**], with the diagnosis of tracheal bronchitis
versus chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare, versus
atypical pneumonia, status post intubation in the MICU,
chronic secretions/congestion-related problems, on
alternating regimen of Augmentin and Bactrim since [**2534-9-23**] for multiple bronchitic-like infections, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure,
atrial fibrillation, prior PEs, diabetes type 2, status post
myocardial infarction, who presented with gradual shortness
of breath beginning on the day of admission.

The patient reported a [**1-24**] day history of general fatigue.
On the day of admission, visiting nurse services reported a
systolic blood pressure of 70.  The wife drove the patient to
the Emergency Room.  The patient also complained of some
dizziness, however denied other symptoms including fever,
chills, sweats, chest pain, diarrhea, constipation, nausea,
vomiting, or urinary symptoms.  He reported good p.o. intake
and appetite.

The patient reported that he has a chronic, slight cough,
however, denied any sputum production.  He took his oral
temperature at home and denied any fever.  At home, the
patient is on oxygen of [**12-26**] L via nasal cannula.  The patient
recently finished a steroid taper on [**8-10**] which was
two weeks in length.  He reported a usual SBP of 80-110.  The
patient did note that since [**Month (only) 213**], a Scopolamine patch was
added to his regimen and has increased his secretions
significantly.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Per Emergency Room, the patient
appeared close to intubation upon presentation and was placed
on 100% oxygen via non-rebreather with an ABG of 7.46, pCO2
of 48, and pO2 of 33.  There was a question if this was a
venous gas or not.  Lasix 100 mg IV, Albuterol nebs,
Solu-Medrol 600 mg IV, and Ceftriaxone 1 g IV was given to
the patient.  When evaluated by the MICU shortly after
arrival to the Emergency Room, the patient was weaned down to
baseline of 2 L oxygen with oxygen saturation of 100% via
nasal cannula.  The patient was breathing comfortably at
18-20 breaths/min.  The patient no longer complained of
shortness of breath but did state that he felt slightly
tired.  Chest x-ray was negative, and a CT showed no acute
PE.  The patient reported that he was back to baseline in the
Emergency Room.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Stage III squamous cell lung
cancer diagnosis in [**2534-2-21**], status post right
pneumonectomy in [**2534-6-23**], with radiation, Carboplatin,
and Taxol treatments.  2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease with PFTs in [**2535-5-23**] showing an FEV1 of 0.83 L,
which is 25% of predicted, and FEV1 to FVC ration of 68% of
predicted.  3.  Congestive heart failure with preserved left
ventricular function in [**2535-5-23**].  4.  Atrial fibrillation.
This was noted perioperatively.  5.  Prostate carcinoma
diagnosed in [**2531-2-21**] status post radical prostatectomy in
[**2531-8-23**].  6.  Diabetes type 2.  7.  History of
urosepsis.  8.  History of PE during the patient's
postoperative course in [**2534-6-23**].  9.  Status post

ventricular function, ejection fraction of 50%, and a 30%
right coronary artery lesion.  10.  Status post transient
ischemic attack in [**2524**].  11.  Gout.  12.  Gastroesophageal
reflux disease.  13.  Sleep apnea.  14.  Colonic polyps noted

mg q.h.s.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with wife and quit smoking
in [**2534-5-23**].  He smoked 3-4 packs per day for 40 years.  No
alcohol abuse.  He is a retired construction worker.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Sister died at age 39 of cancer.  Brother is
status post coronary artery bypass grafting.  Father with
history of coronary artery disease.  Sister with heart valve
disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.5??????, heart
rate 70, blood pressure 89-122/60-77, respirations 19-20,
oxygen saturation 100% on 2 L nasal cannula.  General:  The
patient was in no apparent respiratory distress.  He was
comfortable.  He was alert and awake.  HEENT:  Pupils equal,
round and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular
movements intact.  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Moist mucous
membranes.  Oropharynx clear.  Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate
and rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2.  Distant heart sounds.
Without murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Lungs:  Loud rhonchi
throughout the left lung field.  No apparent wheezing or
rubs.  Transmitted sounds to right side.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended.  No hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  Without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 10.4, hematocrit 30.0, which is
baseline, platelet count 388; CHEM7 was unremarkable; PT
22.5, PTT 31.3, INR 3.5; B12 327, folate 12.7.

Electrocardiogram unchanged from prior.  Theophylline level
4.3.

Chest x-ray showed status post right pneumonectomy, left lung
with no congestive heart failure, no pneumonia, no
pneumothorax, no effusion.  CT angiogram showed no acute PE,
possible chronic PE in pulmonary artery segment in the left
lower lobe that is not occlusive.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was a 62-year-old male with a past
medical history of lung carcinoma status post right
pneumonectomy, multiple recent hospitalizations since [**Month (only) 202**]
for bronchitic-like infections, on chronic alternating
antibiotic regimen of Augmentin and Bactrim, recent
hospitalization in MICU with intubation, chronic secretions,
and congestive-related problems, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, on home oxygen, congestive heart failure,
prior PEs, history of atrial fibrillation, who presented with
respiratory distress.

1.  Respiratory distress:  The patient was given Lasix,
Albuterol nebs, and Solu-Medrol in the Emergency Department
and had rapid improvement of his symptoms.  It was thought
that the patient's acute respiratory distress was most likely
secondary to mucous plugging.  PE was ruled out by CTA.
Chest x-ray showed no clear signs of congestive heart failure
or pneumonia.  The patient also recently completed a steroid
taper for possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
component and was not clearly bronchospastic during this
admission.  He had no cough and no sputum production and no
fevers.  The patient was rapidly tapered off of steroids, as
it was thought that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was
unlikely to be the cause of his acute respiratory distress
and because it was unclear whether steroids was really
benefitting this patient.

He continued to have aggressive chest physical therapy for
secretion management and was continued on his Scopolamine
patch, Serevent, Combivent, Atrovent/Albuterol nebs, and
inhalers.  He was also continued on his alternating
prophylactic antibiotic regimen of Augmentin and Bactrim.  He
continued to do well and recorded oxygen saturations of
greater than 92%.  On the day of discharge, oxygen saturation
was 97% on room air.

Of note, the patient was observed in the MICU overnight but
was discharged to the floor quickly and had no other episodes
of respiratory distress.

2.  Hypotension:  The visiting nurse noted a systolic blood
pressure of 70; however, by the time the patient came to the
Emergency Room, he had an SBP of 90.  It was thought that the
patient's slightly decreased SBP was secondary to
hypovolemia.  He was given gentle fluid hydration.  He also
had a cortical stimulation test to assess for renal
insufficiency given that he had just finished his steroid
taper; however, this was done after Solu-Medrol had been
given to the patient.  It was reportedly negative, but it was
unclear as to how accurate this is in the setting of recent
Solu-Medrol dosing.  His Lasix was decreased from 160 mg
b.i.d. to 80 mg b.i.d., and his ACE inhibitor was
discontinued.  He continued to remain normovolemic during the
rest of his hospitalization.

3.  Cardiovascular:  In terms of the patient's history of
perioperative myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and
congestive heart failure, the patient was continued on his
Amiodarone and Lasix 80 mg b.i.d.   He also continued Aspirin
and Lipitor.  His electrocardiogram was unchanged, and it was
thought that there was not any significant cardiac component
to the patient's respiratory distress.

4.  Endocrine:  The patient was continued on his Glyburide
and was covered with an Insulin sliding scale in the
hospital.

5.  History of pulmonary embolus:  The patient was continued
on his Coumadin while in-house.  No further work-up was done.

6.  CODE STATUS:  THE PATIENT IS FULL CODE.

DISPOSITION:  He will be discharged to pulmonary
rehabilitation to try to maximize his pulmonary status.  He
appears to be doing very well with physical therapy during
this hospitalization and has slightly improved his exercise
tolerance.  He will also be started on a Morphine Elixir 5-10
mg sublingually p.r.n. q.6 hours for shortness of breath to
relieve the patient's symptom of air hunger.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Mucous plugging.
3.  Congestive heart failure.
4.  Hypotension.
5.  Diabetes type 2.
6.  History of pulmonary embolus on Coumadin therapy.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient will be discharged to
pulmonary rehabilitation.

FOLLOW-UP:  He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 214**] and his
primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63 year old
male with a past medical history of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, lung cancer, status post right
pneumonectomy in [**2534-1-21**], complicated by pulmonary artery
laceration, status post transtracheal catheter placement for
oxygen and suctioning who was in his usual state of health
until [**2536-11-19**] when he developed nausea, lower
abdominal pain, and projectile vomiting of nonbloody emesis.
He presented to the [**Hospital6 253**]
Emergency Room on [**2536-11-20**].  At that time he denied
diarrhea, constipation, fevers, chills, hematochezia and
bright red blood per rectum.  He had dark stools at baseline
secondary to iron use.  The stool was found to be guaiac
positive in the Emergency Department.  In the Emergency
Department also his hematocrit value was 19, down from a
baseline of 31 one month previously and he was coagulopathic
with an INR of 9.8.  Attempts to place a nasogastric tube in
the Emergency Department were unsuccessful.  While in the
Emergency Department, he was transfused 4 units of packed red
blood cells, 2 units of fresh frozen plasma, and got 2 mg of
subcutaneous Vitamin K.  The patient was admitted to the
Medicine Floor.  Repeat hematocrit several hours later
dropped to a value of 13.  The nasogastric tube was placed on
the floor with nasogastric lavage negative for fresh blood.
He was, at that point, transferred to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit.  Workup while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit
included two esophagogastroduodenoscopies, both without fresh
blood or old blood but demonstrating a single raised 5 to 7
cm esophageal nodule on an erythematous base at approximately
25 cm.  There was no evidence of stigmata of recent bleeding.
He was stabilized with a total of seven units of packed red
blood cells, seven units of fresh frozen plasma and one unit
of platelets.  He also received intravenous fluid
resuscitation with normal saline.  Computerized tomography
scan of the abdomen was performed which was negative for
diverticuli, perforation or retroperitoneal bleed.
Colonoscopy performed later in the hospital course showed
some polyps, diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and
descending colon.  Internal hemorrhoids were noted but no
stigmata of recent bleeding.  The patient's coagulopathy was
improving.  His hematocrit was stable, and he was transferred
to the General Medicine Floor on [**2536-11-23**].  Of note,
prior to transfer he developed swelling of the right upper
extremity and complained of pain of the right upper
extremity.  Doppler ultrasound was performed which showed
evidence of a right axillary deep vein thrombosis.

prolonged QT interval, no left ventricular hypertrophy, T
wave inversions were noted in leads V1 and V2 which were new.
No acute ST elevations or depressions noted.  This was
compared with the prior electrocardiogram from [**2536-10-4**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, this is a 63 year old male with
past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, lung cancer status post right pneumonectomy in
[**2534-1-21**] complicated by a pulmonary artery laceration,
status post transtracheal catheter placement for oxygen and
suctioning.  He was in his usual state of health until
[**2536-11-19**] when he developed nausea, lower abdominal
pain, projectile vomiting of nonbloody emesis.  His
hematocrit dropped from 31 to a nadir of 13.  His
gastrointestinal workup was unrevealing in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.

1.  Anemia secondary to acute blood loss - The patient's
gastrointestinal workup included two
esophagogastroduodenoscopies and colonoscopy times one
without source of frank bleed.  However, in light of his
initial complaints of nausea, abdominal pain, and guaiac
positive stool a gastrointestinal source was still suspected.
Physically the small bowel could be the source.  After
stabilization in the Medical Intensive Care Unit with blood
products, fresh frozen plasma and platelets, he was
transferred to the Medicine Floor after having stable
hematocrit for greater than 24 hours.  While on the floor,
his hematocrit was checked initially every 12 hours.  After
demonstrating stability for a total of 72 hours it was spaced
out to q. day hematocrit checks.  All told the patient
received 7 units of packed red blood cells, 7 units of fresh
frozen plasma and one unit of platelets during his hospital
stay.  On [**2536-11-28**], the patient underwent repeat
esophagogastroduodenoscopy in order to obtain biopsy samples
of the esophageal nodule, not noted on previous study.  At
the time of this dictation results of those biopsies were
pending.  While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit the
patient also had workup for hemolysis to evaluate whether
hemolysis could be attributing to his anemia.  He had a
normal left ventricular hypertrophy, haptoglobin and
bilirubin on admission, however, making hemolysis a very
unlikely explanation for his presentation hematocrit of 19.
Moreover, no schistocytes were seen on peripheral smear.
Hemolysis laboratory data were checked several days into his
hospital course and were consistent with changes status post
large volume transfusion with no evidence of active ongoing
hemolysis.

2.  Right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis - On [**2536-11-23**] the patient began to complain of right upper
extremity pain and swelling.  Doppler ultrasound demonstrated
an axillary deep vein thrombosis.  In light of his recent
bleeding episode, anticoagulation was held initially.
Although upper extremity deep vein thromboses do not embolize
as often as lower extremity deep vein thromboses, there was
still a very high concern for pulmonary embolus in light of
the patient's history of right pneumonectomy and the
functionality of his one remaining lung.  The computerized
tomography scan was performed to better examine the right
upper extremity soft tissues.  In particular there was
concern that the patient might have an obstructing mass
lesion or fibrosis-post his pneumonectomy that could be
contributing to venous stasis and obstruction leading to deep
vein thrombosis formation.  Computerized tomographic venogram
was without evidence of obstructing lesion of fibrosis,
however.  The patient is likely hypercoagulable as evidenced
by the development of this right upper extremity deep vein
thrombosis spontaneously after being off anticoagulation in
the setting of his acute bleed for only several days, there
was concern for recurrent deep vein thromboses.  Therefore,
an inferior vena cava filter was placed on [**2536-11-27**].
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  On [**2536-11-29**], the patient then began to complain of pain and swelling
of the right lower extremity.  Examination was consistent
with possible thrombus of the right lower extremity.
However, as the patient already had an inferior vena cava
filter placed and delineation of a right lower extremity deep
vein thrombosis would not change management plans at all, the
decision was made not to undergo ultrasound doppler imaging
of the right lower extremity.  In light of his probable
hypercoagulability, decision was made to reinitiate
anticoagulation with the Coumadin.  His Coumadin level will
be followed by his outpatient physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
His INR should be checked remotely at the rehabilitation
facility and his Coumadin dose adjusted accordingly for a
goal INR of 2 to 3.

3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/lung carcinoma
status post right pneumonectomy - The patient was continued
on aggressive regimen of chest physical therapy and pulmonary
toilet.  He was continued on his outpatient medicines,
Combivent, Salmeterol, and Theophylline.  He was continued on
antibiotic prophylaxis with Bactrim Double Strength in light
of his history of bronchiectasis.  He was monitored for acute
decompensation and his respiratory status, particularly
concerning for pulmonary embolism in light of his right upper
extremity deep vein thrombosis.  He continued to improve from
a respiratory standpoint.  He was diuresed gently after
arriving to the Medicine Floor status post fluid
resuscitation and blood product administration in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit in the setting of his acute bleed.  With
the diuresis, pulmonary toilet and supportive care, his
respiratory status improved somewhat.  However, he is not
back to his baseline of 2 liters of oxygen nasal cannula at
home.  At the time of discharge he was maintaining
saturations in the 97 to 100% range on 4 liters but he
continued to complain of increased dyspnea with activity and
shortness of breath, occasionally at rest.  It was felt that
a lot the patient's dyspnea was secondary to muscle
deconditioning due to his prolonged illness and hospital
stay.  Therefore he will be discharged to a pulmonary
rehabilitation program in hopes of increasing his
conditioning and improving his overall pulmonary status.

4.  Diabetes mellitus 2 - The patient was maintained on a
diabetic diet, with q.i.d. fingersticks, fingerstick blood
glucose testing and coverage with a regular insulin sliding
scale.  He was maintained on his outpatient dose of Neurontin
for neuropathy.

5.  Atrial fibrillation - He was continued on his outpatient
dose of Amiodarone.  Of note, he is currently in sinus
rhythm.

6.  Acute renal failure - The patient on admission had an
elevated creatinine level above his baseline.  This was
likely secondary to prerenal causes, specifically hypovolemia
and intravascular volume depletion in the setting of his
acute bleeding episode.  His acute renal failure resolved
after fluid hydration.

7.  Vitamin B12 deficiency - The patient was continued on his
outpatient regimen of supplementation with Vitamin B12, 1000
mcg p.o. b.i.d.

8.  Hypercholesterolemia - The patient was continued on his
outpatient dose of Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.

9.  Depression/anxiety - The patient was continued on his
outpatient dose of Paroxetine 20 mg p.o. q.d.

10.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient was fed
a diabetic heart-healthy diet.  He received supplementation
with multivitamins and Vitamin B12.  Electrolytes were
aggressively repleted.  At the time of discharge he was
tolerating regular diet without nausea, vomiting or other
incident.

DISPOSITION:  With the patient's general deconditioning as
well as his pulmonary status being slightly below his
baseline I felt that he would benefit from an inpatient
pulmonary rehabilitation program.  He will be discharged to
such a program.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Hemodynamically stable.  Afebrile.
Oxygen saturation stable on 4 liters of nasal cannula,
ambulating independently, tolerating [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 240**] intake without

149, CK 96, troponin 0.06.

EKG with sinus rhythm at 94 with normal axis; poor baseline;
no other ST-T wave changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 63-year-old man with multiple
medical problems who was recently admitted with severe anemia
and likely lower gastrointestinal bleed who had multiple
polypectomies in the ascending and transverse colon on
[**2537-1-10**] and represented with lower abdominal pain and
bright red blood per rectum and anemia.

1.  Gastrointestinal bleed and blood loss anemia:  Most
likely secondary to complication from recent colonoscopy and
polypectomy.  Patient had a negative EGD and then had a
colonoscopy which did show a bleeding vessel at the site of
previous polypectomy.  This was clipped with two clips with
good control of the bleeding.

Patient's hematocrit remained stable.  He did receive a total
of four units of packed red blood cells on this admission.
After colonoscopy with clipping, no further melena or bright
red blood per rectum was noted.  Patient's hematocrits were
followed serially and remained in the 26, 27 range and
eventually was transfused the fourth unit day prior to
discharge, but his hematocrit remained 29 and 31 on day of
discharge.

Otherwise, symptomatically much improved and slowly advanced
his diet from liquids to soft mechanical diet, which he
tolerated well with no further episodes of melena or bright
red blood per rectum.

Patient was initially started on Protonix 40 intravenously
b.i.d. as his EGD was negative.  Eventually was switched back
to his 40 p.o. q. day regimen which he continued even as an
outpatient for his gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Patient's blood pressure remained stable after transfused
with blood.  He also had a negative tagged red cell scan and
negative EGD.  Eventually, after colonoscopy, had a small
bowel follow through to rule out any source of blood loss as
in his previous admission.  This was also negative.  Patient
could not have a Meckel scan during this stay because of
barium and can have it at least one week after barium
ingestion.

Because of the recent colonoscopy and the bleed, patient's
Lovenox dose and Coumadin dose were continued to be held.
Patient's anticoagulation, including aspirin, Coumadin, and
Lovenox, were to be held for at least one week and can be
restarted on [**2537-1-22**] per GI.

2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  Patient's
respiratory status was stable and at baseline.  Continued his
home regimen of Advair, Combivent, and Theophylline and
p.r.n. nebulizers as needed, although his pulmonary exam
remained stable and he was at his baseline home oxygen of 2
liters and will be discharged on the same regimen.

3.  Status post lung cancer, status post pneumonectomy:  Was
stable with tracheostomy.  Continued b.i.d. suctioning with
good results.  Continue the Scopolamine patch for
antiemetics.

4.  Prostate cancer:  He does have recently rising PSA most
recently 8.9 in 02/[**2536**].  Patient was eventually able to have
a bone scan during the course of his stay which was negative
for metastases, only positive for previous post surgical bony
changes.  Patient will be followed up with urologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 258**], in terms of his prostate cancer follow up.

5.  Troponin leak:  This was attributed to demand ischemia.
He had negative EKG changes, and he had a catheterization in
[**1-/2534**] which revealed 30% mid lesion but no flow-limiting
disease.  His enzymes remained stable through the course of
his stay and was attributed to his anemia.  Patient's aspirin
was held because of the bleeding and can be restarted
[**2537-1-22**].  Patient was continued on his statin.

6.  Atrial fibrillation:  Patient was in sinus rhythm
throughout the course of his stay and was stable on
Amiodarone.  Again, his Coumadin was held for concerns with
bleeding.

7.  Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolus:  He has a
history of [**Location (un) 257**] filter and right upper and right lower
extremity deep venous thrombosis.  His hypercoagulable state
is likely attributed to the prostate cancer, but otherwise
his Coumadin was held for the bleeding reasons, and patient
did have increasing amounts of swelling of his right upper
and right lower extremity.

Patient was taken off his Lasix dose through the course of
the stay because of concern for hemodynamic instability.  Was
given p.r.n. doses of Lasix throughout the stay and continued
to elevate his extremities with good results of them.

Patient did have both upper and lower extremity ultrasounds
done to rule out new deep venous thrombosis.  The right lower
extremity ultrasound was negative.  The right upper extremity
did show the old known thrombus in the right basilic vein but
no progression or change from previous studies, and this
otherwise was stable throughout the course of his stay.

8.  Diabetes:  He has fairly good control with hemoglobin A1C
most recently at 6.0.  He was continued on his home regimen
of Glyburide once he was taking p.o. and covered with sliding
scale as needed.

For his neuropathy patient was continued on his Tylenol
Number 3 and was discharged with a prescription for Morphine
sulfate per his request, although he was not continued on
this during the course of his stay.

9.  Gout:  This was stable throughout the course of his
admission, but patient was continued on his home dose of
Colchicine.
